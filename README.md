> An intuitive, community focused Discord bot with powerful server onboarding functionality.

GateKeeper is a specialised bot made for [Discord](https://discord.com/) which focuses on enhancing the experience for new members of your Discord community. It was originally developed over a year ago to remedy problems faced by community administrators trying to onboard new members by providing a unique suite of tools.

While GateKeeper is a closed source project, we are eager to implement new features and stay at the forefront of Discord's ever-growing library of tools for community servers. If you feel GateKeeper is missing a feature or have a 'crazy' idea no other bot developer has implemented, feel free to make a feature request by using the command `/feedback` (coming soon) or send us a message over on the [support server](https://support.gatekeeperbot.net).

## Support The Devs

Hosting GateKeeper requires expensive servers (which in turn use expensive electricity) which keeps the bot online with least possible downtime! Because of this we ask for your support, for the cost of a coffee each month you can help keep our dream alive and also snag yourself a handful of extra unique and amazing features. ðŸ’™
