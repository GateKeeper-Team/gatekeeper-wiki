# Getting Started

[![Requires-Rule-Screening](https://img.shields.io/badge/WORKS%20WITH-RULE%20SCREENING-FEE75C?style=for-the-badge)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882-Rules-Screening-FAQ)

Welcome messages are sent to a specific channel when a user joins a server and accepts the rule screening. They can be customized with special messages as well as images and gifs.

If you have rule screening enabled on your server, the welcome message will be sent when the user accepts the rules. Otherwise, the message will be sent immediately when a user joins.

## Where to go next?

* **Setup welcome message** options by heading to the next page.

{% content-ref url="enabling-disabling-message.md" %}
[enabling-disabling-message.md](enabling-disabling-message.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **You may want to setup rule screening** if you haven't already (auto-role not required).

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
